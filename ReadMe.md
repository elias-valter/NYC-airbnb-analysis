## Project overview
This data analysis project aims to provide further insights to the NYC Airbnb portfolio. By analyzing various aspects of the data, I seek to identify trends, make data-drive recommendations for booking and gain a deeper understanding of the NYC Airbnb market.

### Data Sources
I found this dataset on kaggle. See more: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/airbnbs-nyc-overview/data

### Data Cleaning & Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Data Analysis & Visualization
I run a lot of analysis including price distribution, price trends over time and differences between neighborhoods. For the analysis used descriptive statistics via seaborn and matplotlib

### Results & Recommendations
- most Airbnbs are located in Manhattan and Brooklyn
- Brooklyn's average price is ca. 35% lower than in Manhattan and only 25% higher than in Queens
- in overall numbers, in Manhattan has the most "entire homes / apartments" whereas Brooklyn is the place to be for "private rooms"
- there are now significant price trends since 2013

- You will find the best value for money in Brooklyn
- If are looking for an apartment, Manhattan is the place to be 
- If you can't find anything in Brooklyn or Manhattan, the next place to look is Queens for selection and price
